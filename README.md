# CancerPrediction_FlutterApp
Flutter app based on two CNN models to predict brain tumor and skin cancer.

Brain tumor model building and training can be found here -> https://github.com/pranauv1/Brain_Tumor_Classification
<br>Skin cancer model building and training can be found here -> https://github.com/pranauv1/Skin_Cancer
<br><br>
The models above are not good with real world predictions as the training data set is obtained from a Kaggle competiotions. (Images need to be manually modified before prediction)
